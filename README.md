# SAMe - Stocks Algorithms Model ensemble.

The Project is built with following ideologies:
1. Every Pattern:
    - can have it's own dimensions which are specific to that pattern itself.
    - can also have different input parameters. (for example Moving Average Pattern can have type as SMA, EMA, EWMA etc.)

2. Pattern will emit out a signal - Signal can have a canonical structure, so that it can serve as an agnostic interface.
